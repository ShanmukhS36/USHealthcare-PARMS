# USHealthcare-PARMS
Prior Authorization Request Management System (PARMS)
Project Overview
This project simulates a **US Healthcare** web application used by physicians and clinics to submit **prior authorization (PA) requests** to insurance companies (payers). It aims to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, tracking, and appealing PA requests in a HIPAA-compliant manner.

The system reduces treatment delays, ensures appropriate documentation, and improves communication between **provider** and **payer** stakeholders.
